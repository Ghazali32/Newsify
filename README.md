# Newsify

Newsify: A Flutter news app built with clean architecture. It included a SQLite-based Database to store the articles offline. The main purpose of implementing the architecture is the separation of concern (SoC). It will be easier if we can work by focusing on one thing at a time.

# note:
This Repository is still under development and I will continue to add new features to it.
